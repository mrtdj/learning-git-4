				<h2>Tenacious D Kickapoo</h2>
				<p>A long ass fuckin' time ago,<br>
					In a town called Kickapoo,<br>
					There lived a humble family<br>
					Religious through and through.<br>
					But yay there was a black sheep<br>
					And he knew just what to do.<br>
					His name was young J.B. and he refused to step in-line.<br>
					A vision he did see-eth<br>
					Fuckin' rockin' all the time.<br>
					He wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align.</p>
				<p>Oh the dragons balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave,<br>
					Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles,<br>
					With a long and shiney blade!<br>
					'Twas I who fucked the dragon,<br>
					Fuckalize sing-fuckaloo!<br>
					And if you try to fuck with me,<br>
					Then I shall fuck you too!<br>
					Gotta get it on in the party zone!<br>
					I gots to shoot a load in the party zone!<br>
					Gotta lick a toad in the party zone!<br>
					Gotta suck a chode in the party zone!<br>
					[Crying]</p>
				<p>You've disobeyed my orders, son,<br>
					Why were you ever born?<br>
					Your brother's ten times better than you,<br>
					Jesus loves him more.<br>
					This music that you play for us comes from the depths of hell.<br>
					Rock and roll's The Devil's work, he wants you to rebel.<br>
					You'll become a mindless puppet;<br>
					Beelzebub will pull the strings!<br>
					Your heart will lose direction,<br>
					And chaos it will bring.<br>
					You'd better shut your mouth,<br>
					Better watch your tone!<br>
					You're grounded for a week with no telephone!<br>
					Don't let me here you cry,<br>
					Don't let me hear you moan!<br>
					You gotta praise The Lord when you're in my home!</p>
